# c-vectors
Custom vector implementation in c

This is a very (terrible) implementation of vectors and matrices in c. I will expand upon this repository as my skills get better - TODO'S include: 

* Hardware and memory optimizations.
* Eliminate all possible sources of memory leaks.
* Computational tricks and approximations.
* Support for more operations (curl, div etc.) 
* Flexibility (function overloading, generics, etc.)
